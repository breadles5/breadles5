## About me
I am currently a developer in high school.   
I mostly develop random stuff here for Tosu! overlays and other stuff.   
I like most things computer related like prompt engineering, graphic design, programming, etc.

You can find my overlay's here:
 - [custom hit error bar](https://github.com/breadles5/customHitErrorBar)
 - [mania now playing](https://github.com/breadles5/maniaNowPlaying)
 - [custom hits counter with chart](https://github.com/breadles5/mania-hit-count-and-chart/)

I do graphic design for osu! skinning.

I'll (probably) add my skins here later as well.
